TODO user should be able to edit card/ delete it
TODO user should be able to edit deck/ delete it
TODO maybe make an option to make your deck public and other users can add it and use it. For now, it looks difficult to implement.


CARDS HAVE TO HAVE MORE ROWS

CREATED - shows the date when a card was created
REVIEW_DATE - shows review date of  CARDS

EASE_FACTOR ? - some number that will determine where will be next review depends on an answer of the user
FOR EXAMPLE:
    there will be 2 answers  DON'T KNOW/ KNOW

    if KNOW easer_factor will increase and change review_date for later
    on that button you should be able to see where will be next review(in days) when you choose that option


    if don't KNOW

        REVIEW_DATE will be set on the same day to repeat a card and EASE_FACOTR will reset (like memrise website)
        OR WILL DECREASE AND DOESN'T LOSE YOUR WHOLE PROGRESS WITH THAT CARD(SIMILAR LIKE ANKI WORKS)

CREATE ENDPOINTS TO DISPLAY CARDS THAT NEED TO BE REVIEW THAT DAY,  DISPLAY CARD BY CARD AND MAKE POSSIBILITY TO ANSWER THEM

IF USER DON'T REVIEW EVERY DAY CARDS SHOULD PILE UP

TODO as exercise maybe make a possibility for a user to have a reminder, the app will send an email every day with information how many cards the user have to review that day.

TODO make a possbility to generate pdf with all user cards from deck
TODO maybe using web scraping to help the user to find a translation or to generate audio using some API
TODO as a exercise maybe let the user to upload something to the app like words and translation in some excel format/ app will read it and create a deck based on it.

TODO I know that you can write code to generate create migrations to the database by yourself, what makes working with db faster and less annoying when you change something. If it would be worth to learn I will use it/ if not later i will use migrations from SQLALCHEMY framework but I want to implement it at the end when will polish app.

TODO user cookies/ learn how they work. make later JWT


TODO implement logging by google account or something like that ? implement some payments method as an exercise ?


TODO maybe it would be difficult I don't know but maybe make an option when you make flashcards with a word that you don't know and on each review app will give you different sentences from the internet with that world instead of having only one context or only translation OR SIMPLE during review you will be able to ask for examples and app will give you some 2-3 random sentences from the internet. MAYBE FROM DICTIONARY WEBSITE.

TODO using some library let users see some theirs statistics ? like showing a chart of how many reviews they did every day in the last week? HOW to store data like this
